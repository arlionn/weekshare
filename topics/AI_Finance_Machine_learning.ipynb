These tools empower researchers to incorporate rich but subjective textual data into advanced empirical analysis. NLP tools have pros and cons, and some are better suited to certain research agendas. Research using these tools has exploded in prevalence over the past ten years, and we document the major contributions in corporate finance, asset pricing, and beyond. These tools offer the flexibility to test hypotheses that were not possible before their advent, while also offering improvements in the clarity of identification and the ability to separate hypotheses that purport to explain a set of findings. Finally, we identify challenges and directions for future work."

These models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in understanding context, processing vast amounts of data, and generating human-preferred contents. In this survey, we explore the application of LLMs on various financial tasks, focusing on their potential to transform traditional practices and drive innovation. We provide a discussion of the progress and advantages of LLMs in financial contexts, analyzing their advanced technologies as well as prospective capabilities in contextual understanding, transfer learning flexibility, complex emotion detection, etc. We then highlight this survey for categorizing the existing literature into key application areas, including linguistic tasks, sentiment analysis, financial time series, financial reasoning, agent-based modeling, and other applications. For each application area, we delve into specific methodologies, such as textual analysis, knowledge-based analysis, forecasting, data augmentation, planning, decision support, and simulations. Furthermore, a comprehensive collection of datasets, model assets, and useful codes associated with mainstream applications are presented as resources for the researchers and practitioners. Finally, we outline the challenges and opportunities for future research, particularly emphasizing a number of distinctive aspects in this field. We hope our work can help facilitate the adoption and further development of LLMs in the financial sector."

By pre-training the models on year-specific financial datasets from 2007 to 2023, the study also mitigates look-ahead bias, a common limitation of general-purpose LLMs. The findings highlight the critical importance of addressing look-ahead bias to ensure reliable results. Extensive robustness checks further validate the superior performance of these models."

Although the expressions \"Market Generator\" and its related form \"Market Simulator\" have only entered the vocabulary of financial modeling around 2019, today, the modeling techniques related to them have already grown into an area of its own right. This growing interest is matched by a dramatic rise in research, publications, and an accelerating rate of innovation in the ambient technological arena of generative modeling.

Using the GPT 3.5 model to generate risk summaries and assessments from the context provided by earnings call transcripts, we show that GPT-based measures possess significant information content and outperform the existing risk measures in predicting (abnormal) firm-level volatility and firms' choices such as investment and innovation. Importantly, information in risk assessments dominates that in risk summaries, establishing the value of general AI knowledge. We also find that generative AI is effective at detecting emerging risks, such as AI risk, which has soared in recent quarters. Our measures perform well both within and outside the GPT's training window and are priced in equity markets. Taken together, an AI-based approach to risk measurement provides useful insights to users of corporate disclosures at a low cost."

We provide standardized and anonymous financial statements to GPT4 and instruct the model to analyze them to determine the direction of firms' future earnings. Even without narrative or industry-specific information, the LLM outperforms financial analysts in its ability to predict earnings changes directionally. The LLM exhibits a relative advantage over human analysts in situations when the analysts tend to struggle. Furthermore, we find that the prediction accuracy of the LLM is on par with a narrowly trained state-of-the-art ML model. LLM prediction does not stem from its training memory. Instead, we find that the LLM generates useful narrative insights about a company's future performance. Lastly, our trading strategies based on GPT's predictions yield a higher Sharpe ratio and alphas than strategies based on other models. Our results suggest that LLMs may take a central role in analysis and decision-making.\n"
